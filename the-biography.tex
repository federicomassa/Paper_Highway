He was summer student at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva. He received his Ph.D. degree in robotics and automation from the University of Pisa in 2009. During his Ph.D., he enrolled in the International Curriculum Option of doctoral studies in hybrid control for complex, distributed and heterogeneous embedded systems, and he has actively participated in various European Union Projects. He led the University of Pisa Team at the first European Space Agency's Lunar Robotics Challenge, where the team came in second place. His research interests include Boolean consensus and intrusion detection in distributed robotic systems. He is carrying on his activity at the University of Pisa, where he serves as a postdoc researcher.
