@phdthesis{Frazzoli-phdthesis,
	Abstract = {This dissertation focuses on the problem of motion planning for agile
	autonomous vehicles. In realistic situations, the motion planning
	problem must be solved in real-time, in a dynamic and uncertain
	environment. The fulfillment of the mission objectives might also
	require the exploitation of the full maneuvering capabilities of
	the vehicle. The main contribution of the dissertation is the development
	of a new computational and modelling framework (the Maneuver Automaton),
	and related algorithms, for steering underactuated, nonholonomic
	mechanical systems. The proposed approach is based on a quantization
	of the system's dynamics, by which the feasible nominal system trajectories
	are restricted to the family of curvesthat can be obtained by the
	interconnection of suitably defined primitives. This can be seen
	as a formalization of the concept of {\em maneuver}, allowing for
	the construction of a framework amenable to mathematical programming.
	This motion planning framework is applicable to all time-invariant
	dynamical systems which admit dynamic symmetries and relative equilibria.
	No other assumptions are made on the dynamics, thus resulting in
	exact motion planning techniques of general applicability. Building
	on a relatively expensive off-line computation phase, we provide
	algorithms viable for real-time applications. A fundamental advantage
	of this approach is the ability to provide a mathematical foundation
	for generating a provably stable and consistent hierarchical system,
	and for developing the tools to analyze the robustness of the system
	in the presence of uncertainty and/or disturbances. In the second
	part of the dissertation, a randomized algorithm is proposed for
	real-time motion planning in a dynamic environment. By employing
	the optimal control solution in a free space developed for the maneuver
	automaton (or for any other general system), we present a motion
	planning algorithm with probabilistic convergence and performance
	guarantees, and hard safety guarantees, even in the face of finite
	computation times. The proposed methodologies are applicable to
	a very large class of autonomous vehicles: throughout the dissertation,
	examples, simulation and experimental results are presented and
	discussed, involving a variety of mechanical systems, ranging from
	simple academic examples and laboratory setups, to detailed models
	of small autonomous helicopters. },

	Abstract = {Collaboration in sensor networks must be fault-tolerant due to the
	harsh environmental conditions in which such networks can be deployed.
	We focus on finding algorithms for collaborative target detection
	that are efficient in terms of communication cost, precision, accuracy,
	and number of faulty sensors tolerable in the network. Two algorithms,
	namely, value fusion and decision fusion, are identified first.
	When comparing their performance and communication overhead, decision
	fusion is found to become superior to value fusion as the ratio
	of faulty sensors to fault free sensors increases. As robust data
	fusion requires agreement among nodes in the network, an analysis
	of fully distributed and hierarchical agreement is also presented.
	The impact of hierarchical agreement on communication cost and system
	failure probability is evaluated and a method for determining the
	number of tolerable faults is identified.},

	safety and efficiency. Through wireless communication and advanced
	sensor technologies, intelligent vehicles will learn of nearby vehicles'
	intentions and dynamics, and of the presence of roadway hazards.
	These IT technologies will allow safe, tightly spaced vehicle clusters
	or platoons and coordinate safe lane merges and collision avoidance
	in intersections and under limited-visibility conditions. For efficiency
	and economy, the wireless communication will probably take place
	directly between vehicles. The resulting intervehicle communication
	(IVC) network will be of the general class of mobile, ad hoc networks
	without a fixed infrastructure. In contrast to railroad dispatch
	system or air traffic control systems, which make decisions in a
	central location and then transmit them to trains or planes, the
	network will rely on ordinary nodes for routing and network management,
	spreading the intelligence and infrastructure throughout the network
	in the vehicles themselves. This article explores the IVC network's
	potential vulnerabilities and emerging research aimed at mitigating
	them. Our project, a security architecture under development called
	SecCar, offers a promising approach to dealing with these risks.},

	Abstract = {Countermeasures for node misbehavior and selfishness are mandatory
    requirements in MANET. Selfishness that causes lack of node activity
    cannot be solved by classical security means that aim at verifying
    the correctness and integrity of an operation. We suggest a generic
    mechanism based on reputation to enforce cooperation among the nodes
    of a MANET to prevent selfish behavior. Each network entity keeps
    track of other entities' collaboration using a technique called
    reputation. The reputation is calculated based on various types
    of information on each entity's rate of collaboration. Since there
    is no incentive for a node to maliciously spread negative information
    about other nodes, simple denial of service attacks using the collaboration
    technique itself are prevented. The generic mechanism can be smoothly
    extended to basic network functions with little impact on existing
    protocols.},

	Abstract = {Analysis, design and implementation of cooperative control strategies
    for multi-robot systems under communication constraints is the topic
    of this thesis. Motivated by a rapidly growing number of applications
    with networked robots and other vehicles, fundamental limits on
    the achievable collaborative behavior are studied for large teams
    of autonomous agents. In particular, a problem is researched in
    detail in which the group of agents is supposed to agree on a common
    state without any centralized coordination. Due to the dynamics
    of the individual agents and their varying connectivity, this problemis
    an extension of the classical consensus problemin computer science.
    It captures a crucial component of many desirable features of multi-robot
    systems, such as formation, flocking, rendezvous, synchronizing
    and covering.

    Analytical bounds on the convergence rate to consensus are derived
    for several system configurations. It is shown that static communication
    networks that exhibit particular symmetries yield slow convergence,
    if the connectivity of each agent does not scale with the total
    number of agents. On the other hand, some randomly varying networks
    allow fast convergence even if the connectivity is low. It is furthermore
    argued that if the data being exchanged between the agents are quantized,
    it may heavily degrade the performance. The extent to which certain
    quantization schemes are more suitable than others is quantified
    through relations between the number of agents and the required
    total network bit rate. The design of distributed coordination and
    estimation schemes based on the consensus algorithm is presented.
    A receding horizon coordination strategy utilizing subgradient optimization
    is developed. Robustness and implementation aspects are discussed.
    A new collaborative estimation method is also proposed. The implementation
    of multi-robot control systems is difficult due to the high systemcomplexity.
    In the final part of this thesis, a hierarchical control architecture
    appropriate for a class of coordination tasks is therefore suggested.
    It allows a formal verification of the correctness of the implemented
    control algorithms.},
